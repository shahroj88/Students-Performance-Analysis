# 📊 Students Performance Analysis

This is a beginner-level data analysis project based on students’ exam performance. The project focuses on understanding the dataset using basic statistics, probability, and simple visualizations.

---

## 📁 Dataset

**File Name:** `StudentsPerformance.csv`

The dataset contains students’ scores in:
- Math
- Reading
- Writing  

It also includes basic demographic information such as gender and parental education level.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Load and inspect the dataset  
- Calculate central tendency (mean, median, mode)  
- Analyze data spread using standard deviation and variance  
- Study the relationship between math and reading scores  
- Calculate basic probability  
- Visualize data using charts and plots  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📌 Analysis Performed

- **Central Tendency:** Mean, Median, Mode  
- **Dispersion & Shape:** Standard deviation, variance, skewness, kurtosis  
- **Correlation:** Relationship between math, reading, and writing scores  
- **Probability:** Probability of scoring ≥80 in both math and reading  
- **Visualizations:** Histogram, box-plot, bar chart, scatter plot, smooth line plot  

---

## 📈 Visualizations

- Histogram of math scores  
- Box plot showing score distribution and outliers  
- Bar chart of average scores by subject   
- Smooth line plot showing trend of math scores  

---

## ✅ Conclusion

The analysis shows that students’ performance is fairly balanced across subjects. Math and reading scores have a positive relationship, which means students who perform well in math generally also perform well in reading. Overall, the dataset shows consistent student performance with moderate variation.
